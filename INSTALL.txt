This library is a header-only library.
That means you don't need to compile anything to use it in your own project.
You can just write :

#include <Plugin/PluginLoader.h>

If you want to generate doxygen documentation, go through the following steps:

*) If you have not alread done so, download source code at https://gitorious.org/cppplugin
*) In the following steps $SOURCE_DIR refers to your local copy of the project
*) cd $SOURCE_DIR
*) mkdir build
*) cd build
*) cmake -DPlugin_BUILD_DOC:BOOL=TRUE ..
*) make

Documentation is now available in $SOURCE_DIR/build/share/doc/html/index.html

After generating documentation, if you want to generate a package with both documentation and source code, type

*) cd $SOURCE_DIR/build
*) make package

An archive file is now available in the current directory.
For example Plugin_v0.0.1.0.tar.gz.
