This library is a header-only library.
That means you don't need to compile anything to use it in your own project.
You can just write :

#include <Plugin/PluginLoader.h>

--------

*) If you have not alread done so, download source code at https://gitorious.org/cppplugin
*) In the following steps $SOURCE_DIR refers to your local copy of the project

--------

If you want to generate doxygen documentation, go through the following steps:

*) cd $SOURCE_DIR
*) mkdir build
*) cd build
*) cmake -DPlugin_BUILD_DOC:BOOL=TRUE ..
*) make

Documentation is now available in $SOURCE_DIR/build/share/doc/html/index.html

--------

If you want to build examples, go through the following steps:

*) cd $SOURCE_DIR
*) mkdir build
*) cd build
*) cmake -DPlugin_BUILD_EXAMPLE:BOOL=TRUE ..
*) make

Examples are now available in $SOURCE_DIR/build/bin

--------

If you want to build tests, go through the following steps:

*) cd $SOURCE_DIR
*) mkdir build
*) cd build
*) cmake -DPlugin_BUILD_TEST:BOOL=TRUE -DPlugin_BUILD_EXAMPLE:BOOL=TRUE ..
*) make

Note that you need to build examples in order to build and execute tests correctly.
Tests are now available in $SOURCE_DIR/build/bin

--------

Then, if you want to generate a package, go through the following steps:

*) cd $SOURCE_DIR/build
*) make package

An archive file is now available in the current directory.
For example Plugin_v0.0.1.0.tar.gz.
Note that if you have built the documentation, it will be automatically included in the package.
